# KubePizza
kubepizza is a playful yet practical demo CLI built with System.CommandLine. It simulates a pizza delivery orchestrator — think kubectl, but for pizzas! 🍕 The project showcases all key features of the library: command hierarchies, argument parsing, validation, tab completion, custom help, and testable command handlers
